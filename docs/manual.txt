	3.1.	Warnings
		3.1.1.	Writing files to protected areas
			On Windows machine (with a non-root user on Linux), You cannot send files to C:\ (/root)
			Generally, we do not recommend you to send files to protected areas of the machine.
		
		3.1.2.	When downloading or sending files, the program might appear as "Not Responding", However
			it just downloads or sends the specified file (usually happens with rather large files).

	3.2.	Tips
		3.2.1.	Basic commands for Windows machine:
			cd <DIRECTORY PATH> --> Change directory to specified path (only changes directory for the same command).
			&& --> Join commands by adding '&&' between them.
			dir <DIRECTORY PATH> --> Show content of the specified path.
			del <OBJ PATH> - Delete specified object.
			shutdown -f -s -t 1 --> Immediate force shut down target's computer.
			whoami --> Machine's username and some details.

		3.2.2.	Basic commands for Linux machine:
			cd <DIRECTORY PATH> --> Change directory to specified path (only changes directory for the same command).
			&& --> Join commands by adding '&&' between them.
			ls -al --> Show content of current directory (and each file's permissions).
			pwd --> Show current directory's path.
			whoami --> Machine's username and some details.

		3.2.3.	Using in-line python
			If the remote server has python installed you can use command-line python to interact
			with its python shell by typing: cd <PYTHON.EXE Directory> && python -c "<YOUR CODE>"
			Each command should be followed by a semi-colon (';').

	4.1.	Go to the server's python-shell directoy and send this command: python -c "from tkMessageBox import *;
		[showwarning('Hahahaha','I can see you.',type=OK) for i in range(100)]"
		(That will probably make your target freak out)

	4.2.	Deleting stuff from target's desktop can be very amusing.
